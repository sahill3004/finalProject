    <p>
        Every shopper looks for the best deals & discounts before buying any product. Nowadays
        before purchasing anything the buyers do some online research of the products on the internet. One
        of the major factors which lead to purchasing of any product is cost or pricing. The buyers tend to
        compare prices before purchasing any product. But since it is very difficult to visit each & every website
        for price comparison, there needs to be a solution to automate this process. The Price comparison
        website project proposed here gathers information on product prices from various websites &
        presents it to the users. The users can then choose to buy from the best options available. Even
        Ecommerce traders can use this price comparison website to study their competitors and form new
        strategies accordingly to attract new customers & stay ahead of their competitors.
